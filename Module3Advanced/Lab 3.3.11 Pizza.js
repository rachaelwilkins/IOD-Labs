- Started preparing pizza
- Made the base
- Added the sauce and cheese

Task 2: Make the functions asynchronous by using setTimeout with different time durations, maintaining the right order.
Task 3: Modify the asynchronous functions to use Promises and achieve the required result.
Task 4: Modify the functions to use async/await and achieve the required result */
